Overview
========

This application was required to take a standard pipe-delimited file and take any item in column 33 and append it directly onto the end of the file. 

Requirements
============

This must be easily usable on a client machine on a chron job running in the background. It is worth noting this will still create a popup but a VB script could be used to bypass that. So far this is not a requirement. 
The files should be placed in one folder, c:\new\ , the Batch file will move them to c:\import\ and then run the .exe. the .exe written in c# will then move the file to \output and .bat will remove the files from the import folder

Concerns
========

The python script is not yet up to date for file naming, ammeding and moving. Needs to be completed. 


Fixed issues
============

The batch file was removing the files before the .exe was running. Adding a /wait ensured this didn't happen.
updated to add a "|" at the end of each line as well as the file name from .psv to .csv as per request

Notes
=====
the original c# script was specced by Mark Preston but designed and written by https://gist.github.com/raylu
The compiled .exe can be found at https://www.raylu.net/f/import111.exe
The script has also been provide in Python but cannot be used due to clientside limitations
